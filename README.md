# clonedGraphviz
A simple reimplementation of Graphviz dotgen algorithms using Boost graph library. The idea was to port the Graphviz C project which is now maintained at https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz to C++. All the source files in this project traces their original to a file at the aforementioned Gitlab repository.
